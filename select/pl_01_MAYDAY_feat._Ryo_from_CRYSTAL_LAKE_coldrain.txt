take what you got and leave now
you're wearing out your welcome
no one here wants to see you, hear you
think that you won from day one
but soon the devil will come
you know just why he wants you, don't you?
*
you're crooked desire left us in disarray
misguided, divided at the point of no return
you started a fire, you're gonna watch it burn
try to save yourself like you always do
**
every bridge we build
you think it's yours to
burn it down just burn it down
when everything is gone
you'll wish you only heard us out, heard us out
screaming MAYDAY
act like you've only done good
unfairly miss understood?
play the victim it's so you, what's new?
lie after lie after lie
we all stoped counting the crimes
you know why we can't trust you, don't you?
*Repeat
**Repeat
why don't you choke on yourself
swallow the hate or just fucking go
you set yourself the world on fire
rising higher and higher
but there's nowhere to run
because all of the bridges burned
all you are is a fucking monster,
a walking disaster
you touch it you break it you kill it
just like a cureless cancer
every bridge we build
you think it's yours to burn it down
when everything is gone
you'll wish you only heard us out, heard us out
**Repeat
